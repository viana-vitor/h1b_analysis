# H1B Visa Petitions Exploratory Data Analysis

The H1-B is a temporary (nonimmigrant) visa category that allows employers to petition for highly educated foreign professionals to work in “specialty occupations” that require at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent. Typically, the initial duration of an H-1B visa classification is three years, which may be extended for a maximum of six years. Since the category was created in 1990, Congress has limited the number of H-1Bs made available each year. The current annual statutory cap is 65,000 visas, with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution of higher learning. The application data is available for public access, and it provides key insights on wages, job titles, companies, and location of H1B visa applicants.

I utilize for this exploratory data analysis two datasets retrieved from kaggle that, combined, have H1B applications data from 2011 to 2019.
